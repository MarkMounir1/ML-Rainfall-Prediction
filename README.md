# Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict rainfall using various machine learning algorithms. Accurate rainfall prediction is crucial for agriculture, transportation planning, and disaster management.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to identify the most effective machine learning algorithm for forecasting rainfall. By testing different algorithms and evaluating their performance, we aim to provide insights into which method offers the most accurate predictions.

## Algorithms Tested

We have tested the following machine learning algorithms:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Random Forest
- Decision Trees
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains historical weather data including factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc., along with corresponding rainfall measurements. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned before being used for training and testing the machine learning models.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, numpy).
3. Run the provided Python scripts to train and test the machine learning models.
4. Evaluate the performance of each algorithm based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Analyze the results to determine the most accurate algorithm for rainfall prediction.
